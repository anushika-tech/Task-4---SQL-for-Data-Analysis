# Task-4---SQL-for-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the SQL Data Analysis task for the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to use SQL queries to extract, analyze, and manipulate data from a sample database.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a simplified ecommerce database named `SimpleShop` that includes two tables:
- `customers`: Contains customer details such as ID, name, and city.
- `orders`: Contains order details including order ID, date, customer ID, and amount.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Workbench

## SQL Queries and Analysis
The SQL script file (`SimpleShop_Task.sql`) includes:
- Database creation and table definitions
- Data insertion commands
- Sample data analysis queries demonstrating:
  - Selection and filtering (`SELECT`, `WHERE`)
  - Aggregation (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`)
  - Joins between tables (`INNER JOIN`)
  - Views creation and usage (if applicable)

## Screenshots
The `/screenshots` directory contains images of query outputs showing the results of important SQL statements executed during the task.

## How to Use
1. Load the `SimpleShop_Task.sql` script in MySQL Workbench.
2. Execute the script to recreate the database, tables, and data.
3. Run analysis queries as needed to explore the data.
4. Refer to screenshots for expected output examples.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Learned to efficiently write and optimize SQL queries.
- Familiarized with database schema creation and data relationships.
- Practiced exporting query results and documenting findings.
